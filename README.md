## üîé How it works

Transcription: Plugin extracts the audio from the recorded sessions and uploads it to Google Cloud Storage. The audio is then transcribed using Google Speech-to-Text. The transcript is then saved in a Google Cloud Storage. Once the process is complete, the plugin calls the `bbb-transcription-ready-url` with the transcript URL.

MP4: Plugin converts the recorded session to mp4 format using the `ffmpeg` library. Once the process is complete, the plugin calls the `bbb-mp4-ready-url` with the mp4 URL.

## üìñ Usage

1. You need to pass below meta tags while creating the meeting

   - `bbb-transcription-enabled`: Set this to `true` to enable transcription for the meeting. Default is `false`.
   - `bbb-mp4-enabled`: Set this to `true` to enable mp4 convertion of recording for the meeting. Default is `false`.

   - `bbb-transcription-ready-url` (optional): A URL that will be called when the transcription is ready. The URL will be called with the json payload with following parameters:

     ```
     meeting_name
     start_time
     end_time
     meeting_id
     transcription_url

     ```

   - `bbb-mp4-ready-url` (optional): The URL will be called with the json payload with following parameters when the mp4 conversion is complete:

     ```
      recordingId
      mp4Url

     ```

   - `bbb-transcription-source-language` (optional): The language spoken in the meeting. The value should be a valid language code. For example, `en-US` for English (United States), `en-GB` for English (United Kingdom), `fr-FR` for French (France), etc. You can check allowed language codes [here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages).

2. You can access the transcript and mp4 of the meeting using the below url formats:

- Transcription:

  ```bash
  https://<your-bbb-server>/transcripts/<internal-meeting-id>/transcript.json
  ```
